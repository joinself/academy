## 🚀 The Self Facade: Your Friendly Learning Companion

Think of the Self facade as your knowledgeable friend who helps you navigate a new city. Instead of needing to know every street and shortcut, your friend shows you the best routes and handles the complex navigation while you focus on enjoying the journey.

The facade provides:
- 🎯 **Intention-Clear Methods**: `IssueEmailCredential()` vs. complex builder patterns
- 🔧 **Flexible Configuration**: Custom field names without hardcoding
- 📚 **Educational Examples**: Every method comes with learning-focused examples
- 🚀 **Quick Wins**: Get working code in minutes, not hours

## 🗺️ Repository Structure

This repository is a monorepo containing the following key areas:

- 📚 **/docs**: Source content for our documentation, built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
- 💻 **/sdks**: Contains the source code for the developer-friendly client facades for various languages.
  - `go/`: Go client facade.
  - `java/`: (Placeholder) Java client facade.
  - `mobile/`: (Placeholder) Mobile (Swift/Kotlin) client facades.
- 🧪 **/examples**: Houses practical code examples that correspond to the documentation. These are structured to provide a progressive learning path from beginner to advanced.
  - `go/`: Examples for the Go SDK and client facade.
  - `java/`: (Placeholder) Examples for the Java client facade.
  - `mobile/`: (Placeholder) Examples for the mobile client facades.

## 🧠 Our Learning Philosophy

We believe in learning by doing, with a focus on building confidence through progressive steps:

1.  **🟢 Start Simple**: Begin with easy-to-understand examples that provide quick wins.
2.  **🟡 Build Complexity**: Gradually introduce more advanced concepts and features.
3.  **🔴 Master the Core**: Gain a deep understanding of the underlying SDK for full control.

Each example is designed to teach a specific concept, with clear explanations of "what you'll learn" and "what just happened."
